Additional Task 

Part1: Flagging

Initial Flags

1.Goalscorers Data Quality Issues:

Checked if the minute column is negative or null.
Verified if the scorer, own_goal, or penalty columns contain null values.
Flagged duplicate rows based on scorer, join_key, and minute (excluding rows where minute is null).

2.Results Data Quality Issues:

Ensured home_score and away_score are non-negative and not null.
Verified that tournament, city, and country columns are not null.

3.Shootouts Data Quality Issues:

Checked if first_shooter is null when there is a declared winner.
Ensured home_team and away_team columns are not null.
Verified the winner is either the home_team or away_team.
Ensured first_shooter is from either the home_team or away_team.
Flagged rows where winner or first_shooter are null.

Part2: Resolve

Focussing on Goalscorers

356 true data quality issues

1.dupliactes
Resolve:
Out of all the rows that have data quality issues the duplicates I visually could find based on minute being same aswell as scorer so I focused on rows where the minute value was not null and removed duplicates based on date, home_team, away_team, scorer, and minute.

Before e.g

date	home_team	away_team	team	scorer	minute	own_goal	penalty	join_key	data_quality_issue
2023-06-18	Netherlands	Italy	Italy	Federico Dimarco	6.0	False	False	2023-06-18_Netherlands_Italy	True
2023-06-18	Netherlands	Italy	Italy	Federico Dimarco	6.0	False	False	2023-06-18_Netherlands_Italy	True
2023-06-18	Netherlands	Italy	Italy	Davide Frattesi	20.0	False	False	2023-06-18_Netherlands_Italy	True
2023-06-18	Netherlands	Italy	Italy	Davide Frattesi	20.0	False	False	2023-06-18_Netherlands_Italy	True

After e.g

date	home_team	away_team	team	scorer	minute	own_goal	penalty	join_key	data_quality_issue
2023-06-18	Netherlands	Italy	Italy	Federico Dimarco	6.0	False	False	2023-06-18_Netherlands_Italy	True
2023-06-18	Netherlands	Italy	Italy	Davide Frattesi	20.0	False	False	2023-06-18_Netherlands_Italy	True


2.Minute = NaN
Resolve:
Cannot resolve NaN values for minute as the other data files cannot help us achieve the minute when the goal is scored

3.Own goal is NaN,Penalty is NaN
Resolve:
Cannot resolve NaN values for own goal or penalty as the other data files cannot help us achieve the information of the type of goal.

4.Scorer = NaN
Resolve:
Cannot resolve NaN values for scorer as the other data files cannot help us achieve the information of the scorer of the goal.


Extra Findings

When extracting the rows for the flag of own_goal is NaN I noticed 1 particular game 1980-09-23_Malaysia_Qatar in which own_goal,penalty,minute are NaN but team coloumn has a value so i checked the results dataset for this game and notied that the game is 1-1 but from goalscorers there is no record of both teams scoring a goal only 1 team has scored(Malaysia) so I wanted to check that final score via goalscorers dataset is the same as results dataset final score. When I checked this I found out there are 39 discrepancies in final score from goalscorers vs results datasets


Focussing on Results

My flags resulted in 0 data quality issues

0 true data quality issues

Focussing on Shootouts

476 true data quality issues

When i looked into this the main issue was first_shooter = null

Resolve:
Cannot resolve NaN values for first_shooter as this is determined by toss and this information is not available from other data files

Extra Findings

I checked that the games ending in draw from results are present in shootouts via joinkey however i noticed some are and some are not ,but as i do not know more information about these games i cannot resolve this issue 

I then checked all join_key values in shootouts are present in results and found 1 game not in results. I need more information on this game to feed into results dataset
